        <p>
            OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model set by ISO (International Organization for Standardization). "A reference model" means that OSI model is a framework, a standard for other models to follow. The model consists of seven layers which present a computer network. The layers' purpose is to describe systems interconnection in some kind of consecutive steps. A protocol derived from OSI model does not necessarily have to consist of the same number layers. To sum up, it shows conceptual picture of how networking works.

A session can be defined as "a conversation" - an exchange of transmissions between parties, delimited in time and maintained by the computers until the session termination (synchronization). In connectionless approaches responsibilities of this layer are mainly skipped. However, for example in UDP, we can treat the context (having destination IP and port and other party listening) as some kind of session and assigns this mechanism to this layer.</td>

In case of errors it resends the packets. In case of connection-oriented usages this layer divides the message to smaller parts before sending and constructs whole message from parts when receiving. It ensures the consistency of the data (checksums). However, in case of connectionless applications, when reliabality is not that important, it just sends the packets without establishing the connection (no handshake).</td>

It is used to enable communication between devices that are not on the same physical network (physical address doesn't indicate to which network a device belongs). B. Routing specifies the route of a packet from one network to another. It selects path across one or more networks. </td>

It ensures that two or nodes don't transmit data on the same network at the same time (CSMA/CS Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection). Detects errors and calls nodes for retransmission. Uses MAC addresses.</td>
